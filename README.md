# Invoice App

Welcome to the Invoice App! This web application allows users to create, manage, and search invoices with ease. Built with React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend, this app provides a seamless experience for handling invoicing tasks. With features like search based on customer name and item name, as well as responsive design and pop-up functionality, managing invoices has never been easier.

## Features

*   **Invoice List**: View a list of invoices with essential details such as invoice number, date, customer name, and total amount.
    
*   **Create Invoice**: Easily create new invoices by filling out a form with customer information, invoice date, and item details. The "Add" button opens a form for creating a new invoice, and clicking "Add" in the create invoice form triggers a popup for adding items.
